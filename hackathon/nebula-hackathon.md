Project : **GraphYourCodeVulnerability**
Introduction : Validation of GitHub projects exposure to CVE vulnerabilities and visualize with graph UI

**_Description_** :
These days when log4j vulnerability [CVE-2021-44228](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44228)  exposes many Java servers to the possible exploration by malicious individuals, you as maintainer of the code or the information system is asking yourself :
> Is my code vulnerable to that threat ? 

> Do I have somewhere in my software stack that log4j peace of code ? 

Well you definitely **have to check** if that is true, because you don’t want to be exposed and become a victim of some _Ransomware_ or other malicious threats and actors.

But hey I’m using that code from GitHub repository. Can I check somehow if that repo is vulnerable to this log4j threat, or any other known threat ?
[ **Yes  you will  !!** ](), when we finish this Nebula Hackathon and give to the world powerful solution to verify exposure of your code in GitHub repository to known threats. You will even be able to search and pivot by code library name and find correlated repositories with **exposure to common vulnerabilities** known as **CVE**s.

**_Design_** :
Project will be developed in python and deployed as a web application with Nebula Graph as a backend database.
```
- Custom python code for web application service
- Nginx web server
- Nebula Graph database integrated with Elasticsearch engine
- Javascript visualization library
```
**_Testing_** :
Project will be deployed on a publicly available application server behind Nginx reverse proxy. 
Data set will have already populated graph objects for most popular GitHub repositories, for more than 32000 repositories. 
Users can select any of them and check vulnerability status of all components included in visually attractive graph representation supported with full-text search option. 
For testing we will examine vulnerabilities for [Nebula Repository](https://github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula)
